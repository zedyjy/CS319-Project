        <h2>Application Process for Summer Internships</h2>
        <p>
          The application process for summer internships consists of two stages:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The first stage is to get the company approved by the CS Department
            summer training coordinators.
          </li>
          <li>
            The second stage is to arrange the paperwork needed for the
            internship and is coordinated by the Dean's Office.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This document provides answers to frequently asked questions about
          internships. It is important that the questions are directed to the
          correct people. That is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you have a question regarding the requirements by the CS
            Department or the procedure for having a new company approved for an
            internship, these questions should be directed to the CS Department
            coordinators by using the email address
            <a href="mailto:staj@cs.bilkent.edu.tr">staj@cs.bilkent.edu.tr</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have a question regarding the procedure for entering your
            internship details in the mfstaj system or regarding administrative
            details such as starting dates, acceptance letters, insurance forms,
            etc., you should contact the Dean's Office by using the email
            address
            <a href="mailto:mfstaj@bilkent.edu.tr">mfstaj@bilkent.edu.tr</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please read the following pages and documents first:</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>How can I add a new company to the mfstaj system database?</h3>
        <p>
          You must create a new entry in the mfstaj database and add all the
          required information about the company. Make sure that there is no
          duplicate entry. If the company is approved for another department,
          you do not need to make a new entry; however, you need to follow the
          remaining steps below to get that company approved for the CS
          Department.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must submit the information explained below to the ST coordinators
          via email (<a href="mailto:staj@cs.bilkent.edu.tr"
            >staj@cs.bilkent.edu.tr</a
          >). Then the coordinators will review the information and will decide
          to approve or disapprove the proposed mfstaj entry. The coordinator
          may require additional information. Please make sure you provide the
          complete information and required details in your first request.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Information to submit:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            What is the name of the company, phone number, postal address, and
            web address?
          </li>
          <li>Is the company doing computer engineering work? Explain.</li>
          <li>
            Will your supervisor be a person with a computer engineering degree?
            Explain.
          </li>
          <li>
            Will the tasks that will be assigned to you satisfy the Performance
            Criteria listed in this document? Explain.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The word "Explain" in any question above means that you are really
          required to explain. For example, simply writing "The tasks will
          satisfy the Performance Criteria" will not be accepted as an answer.
          You need to talk to the company and get information about how the
          internship they are planning will satisfy these criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the company is approved in the system, the rest of the process
          will be handled by the Dean's Office. Thus, if you have any questions
          about the remaining procedure, you should contact the Dean's Office
          directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the approval for the company and the application to the
          Dean's Office must be done before you start any internship. Make sure
          that you are aware of the deadlines announced by the Dean's Office.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I do two Summer Trainings in one summer?</h3>
        <p>
          Only one ST can be done per summer: either CS299 or CS399, but not
          both. But in some special cases, an exception may be granted, and two
          STs can be done in one summer. If you need to do two internships in
          the same summer, you need to write a petition letter to the department
          and describe your legitimate reason to request approval for two
          internships.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that you must explain why you need to do two trainings in the
          same summer. You must also provide a legitimate reason about why you
          could not do the CS299 training in the previous summer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Send this letter to
          <a href="mailto:staj@cs.bilkent.edu.tr">staj@cs.bilkent.edu.tr</a>
          together with records of your transcript and your curriculum list
          (downloaded from the SRS system). If your request is approved, it will
          be forwarded to the Dean's Office. They will help you with the rest of
          the process. Thus, once you receive confirmation that your request was
          approved by the CS Department coordinators, you need to contact the
          Dean's Office for the rest of the process.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I do a Summer Training before passing CS 202?</h3>
        <p>
          Passing CS 202 is a prerequisite for taking CS 299. Thus, you cannot
          apply for or do an internship without passing CS 202. There is no
          exception to this.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are taking CS 202 in the summer semester and want to start the
          arrangements for your ST before the announcement of the letter grades,
          you can do so by asking the CS 202 instructor to send an email to the
          Dean's Office indicating your possibility of passing CS 202 in the
          summer school. Then, the Dean's Office may decide to initiate your
          application process and start handling your paperwork. However, you
          still cannot arrange an internship that starts before the official
          announcement of the letter grades.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Can I do a Summer Training and simultaneously register for CS 399
          during the summer school?
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you are planning to graduate by the end of this summer semester,
          you need to register for CS 399 in the summer school, complete your
          internship, submit your report, and have it evaluated by a faculty
          member. This needs to be finished before the fall semester starts.
          Note that you may have to get an incomplete grade if this process
          cannot be completed during the summer school. This incomplete grade
          needs to be converted to a passing grade before the fall semester
          starts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Normally, you register for CS 299 and/or CS 399 during the first
          semester (that is the Fall semester) after your internship.
          Registration for CS 399 (and maybe simultaneously for CS 299) during
          the summer semester applies only to those that are trying to graduate
          in that summer semester.
        </p>

        <h3>
          I did two internships in one summer. How can I register for both CS
          299 and CS 399 in the fall semester?
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you got official permission to do two internships in the same
          summer, the Dean's Office will help you register for CS 399
          simultaneously with CS 299 in the fall semester.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I do two Summer Trainings in the same place?</h3>
        <p>
          CS299 and CS399 must be done in two different companies - doing them
          in the same company is not allowed. This means that, for example,
          doing CS299 and CS399 in two different branches of a company (like
          TUBITAK) or different departments of a company (like ASELSAN) is not
          allowed.
        </p>
        <p>
          One purpose of ST is to get perspective and experience outside the
          university. You should see the working world, experience real-life
          projects, etc. Just writing code is not the aim. Seeing and working
          with two different sets of people, environments, organizations, teams,
          management, polices, products, and services, etc. is important.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I do an academic Summer Training?</h3>
        <p>
          Doing an academic ST (for example at a university or research
          institution) is not allowed.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I do a Summer Training during the winter break?</h3>
        <p>
          Doing ST in the winter is not allowed. One exception is for a student
          that will finish all courses at the end of the Fall semester and for
          some legitimate reason could not do both required STs earlier. Then
          such a student can do ST in January.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another exception is when a student goes to an exchange program that
          starts later in spring and lasts during the summer. If there is
          sufficient time between the ending date of the fall semester at
          Bilkent and the starting date of the exchange program in spring, the
          student may be allowed to do an internship during this break.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I do my ST for longer than 4 weeks (20 working days)?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, you can. The minimum is 20 days, but longer work experiences are
          often better. Doing more than 4 weeks is optional, but it is
          encouraged. The University can provide health insurance. Consult the
          Dean's Office if the company cannot provide this. Students that do the
          internship abroad may be required to have an insurance policy from
          Turkey as well.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I do my ST abroad?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, you can do your ST abroad. There are no restrictions on doing the
          ST outside of Turkey. However, you need to contact the Dean's Office
          to get information about the necessary steps to take for internships
          abroad.
        </p>

        <h3>Who will evaluate the internship report?</h3>
        <p>
          Your supervisor at the company will write an evaluation report about
          you, your work, and your performance. This report must be submitted to
          the Dean's Office. Note that the evaluation report is sent directly to
          the Dean's Office by the company.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, you need to submit your own report to your assigned faculty
          member by the announced deadline. The faculty member will evaluate
          your report and decide whether you have passed or failed.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I do my Summer Training during the weekends only?</h3>
        <p>
          No, it is not allowed. The ST is expected to be a full-time activity
          during the summer. However, in some special cases, such as when the
          company can provide only a part-time opportunity or when there are
          special arrangements made for the student, the ST coordinators may
          approve a part-time internship. These cases are evaluated on an
          individual basis.
